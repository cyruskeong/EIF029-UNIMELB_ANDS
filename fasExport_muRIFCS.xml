      <description type="brief">Founders and Survivors</description>
      <description type="full">Founders and Survivors is a partnership between historians, genealogists, demographers and population health researchers. The project has brought together a number of research data sets created from records relating to the 73,000 convicts transported to Tasmania in the 19th century and their descendents to create an online, searchable population database of national and international significance for historical, demographic and population health researchers.

The records created of our convict founders are the most detailed descriptions of the bodies and lives of men, women and children created anywhere in the world in the 19th century. No other settler society has such a record of their founders' heights, eye colour, literacy, skills, family history, problems and temperament. We know so much about them when they were in the convict system, but we know very little about most of them once they were free.

The history of Australia will be reconstructed from the grass-roots up, starting with the most disadvantaged of Australia's colonial settlers: the men, women and children transported as convicts to Van Diemen's Land. Families will be followed looking at life span, health, families, occupations and where they settled. They will then be connected with those who served in the AIF in World War 1 and compare the service records of the male descendants of male convicts to investigate changes in height, childhood diet and health, and resilience under stress.

      <description type="brief">The Founders and Survivors Online Database is a searchable population database of all convicts transported to Tasmania in the 19th century.</description>
      <description type="full">The Founders and Survivors Founders and Survivors Online Database brings together a number of research data sets created from various records relating to the 73,000 convicts transported to Tasmania in the 19th century and their descendents. The data was sourced from records of convicts held at the Tasmanian Archives and Heritage Office, various scholarly datasets, and data contributed from genealogists and members of the public with convict ancestors. 

These records include conduct registers, which were kept by the colonial administration to record the behaviour of convicts while they underwent their sentence in the colony. The information recorded falls into two parts: that relating to the convict's history before arrival, and the details of his career in the colony. For each convict their name, ship, and police number and multiple conduct events are transcribed. Each conduct event consists of: a sequence number; date; description; sentence; and the magistrate's initials. Details of all conduct events were transcribed for one in 25 convicts.

Also included in the database are partial transcriptions of the physical description lists, which provide height, eye color, hair color and distinguishing body markings. Muster entries for the years 1930, 1832, 1833 and 1835 are included. If the convict died whilst in the convict system it is likely the details of that death will be found in the database because a wide variety of sources were used to transcribe convict deaths.

The Online Database is searchable by First Name, Surname or Police Number. The search system will query all the records in the database, and when a record is selected show a consolidated view of all the records for a person. This means the system will show all the different spelling of names and then attempt to links those records together to form a person's life history.

For further details of how the search service works, see that related resource.

      <description type="full">
Authoritative register of convicts in Founders and Survivors population category 1.

This index repesents the complete set of convicts who make up population category 1 of the Founders and Survivors project. This category covers all male convicts entering the Van Diemen's Land convict system in the assignment period, from 1818 to approximately 1840. These are represented by the project's transcriptions of every CON31 entry - male convict conduct records.

This convict population is presented in CON31 physical (imaged) sequence in 48 volumes. Alternate presentations for sequence can be made available but this physical archival sequence is considered authoritative.

The index is presented as a web browsable reconstruction of the CON31 series with each volume in its own file. Each entry for a convict provides links to the image of the conduct record page managed by Tasmanian Archive And Heritage Office, the linked records which make up all the data known about the convict in the project, and a link to the convicts entry in the search system. Following the search link takes the user to the convict's life course display which includes all project data which has been matched and linked to that convict presented as a time sequenced set of events. 

Complete details of the CON31 primary source maintained by Tasmanian Archive And Heritage Office sources can be referenced in related information.

      <description type="brief">Transcription of a 1 in 25 sample of complete conduct events from Tasmanian convict Conduct records</description>
      <description type="full">This dataset is a Founders and Survivors source record type: "crs" (Conduct Record Sample).

The "crs" record type is a complete transcription of the conduct events from every 25th Tasmanian Convict conduct record. The conduct record series primary sources are maintained by Tasmanian Archive And Heritage Office. 

This transcription includes a sample taken from the series: CON31, CON33, CON40, CON41 and CON37. Complete details of these primary sources maintained by Tasmanian Archive And Heritage Office (the custodian of the primary sources), please refer to related information.

For each convict their name, ship, and police number and multiple conduct events are transcribed.  Each conduct event consists of:
 * a sequence number
 * date
 * description
 * sentence
 * magistrate (initials)
</description>
      <description type="prot.staff">The "crs" record type has been processed through the standard FAS ingest workflow which converts Excel to XML.

The ingest documentation and codebook are available here:

 * http://founders-and-survivors.org/prot/fasrepo/current/crs/

The XML database "raw_crs" contains the XML form of the data and is described here:

 * http://founders-and-survivors.org/prot/fasrepo/current/documentation/xml-database-descriptions/raw_crs.xml

      <description type="full">This is an online web service provided by the Founders and Survivors project. It is designed to assist the public and project team members to locate VDL convicts which exist in the Founders and Survivors online database. 

The search operates in two stages. 

  1. User enters a surname, given name and/or police number.

     A list of matching convicts is given. Fuzzy searching is supported (names are converted to soundex codes for searching).

  2. User selects a convict from the list provided.

     A life course history of aggregated, time sequenced events for that coinvict is displayed.  This detailed display includes links to evidentiary images managed by Tasmanian Archive And Heritage Office which underpin the presented data.

      <description type="brief">Catalog of Founders and Survivors convict ship prosopography index collections.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection is a catalog of all Convict Ship prosopography index collections which have been published by the Founders and Survivors research project. A separate collection is provided for each convict ship which disembarked convicts at these places in the Australian colonies:
 -- VDL: Van Diemen's Land; or
 -- NI: Norfolk Island; or
 -- PP: Port Phillip

Each Convict Ship prosopography index provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of the convict. This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in these collections serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the research.
These collections serve as the project's public browsable lists of convict names in each ship. The may be republished and extended from time to time to provide additional functionality e.g. inviting public contributions to correct incomplete or erroneous convict data linkage.
Each convict name listed in these collections includes a hyperlink to the full set of aggregated set of matched and linked data deemed to be about this convict from a wide range of sources. These sources include various datasets inherited by the project, and source data selective transcriptions created by the Founders and Survivors research project. The published prosopography index for each ship includes:
 -- summary information for the convict ship (name, date/place of departure, arrival dates, name of master and surgeon, numbers embarked as reported by Bateson);
 -- description of the methodology used, and which sources were aggregated as the basis of the complete prosopgraphy;
 -- details of the record types which, matched together, comprise the names included in the ship;
 -- cross-references (hyperlinks) to relevant primary sources supplied by Tasmanian Archive And Heritage Office.
 -- cross-references (hyperlinks) to further publically available life course data for each convict.

Each ship's prosopography index is published in a directory, named by the ship's project id (999.99), with three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: normal world wide web hypertext markup language format (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format (index.xml); and
 -- (row/column flat) simple flat files, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See note (2) below.

The ships for which a prosopgraphy index collection is published are each listed here as a related object with the relationship "describes".
</description>
      <description type="note">
Quality and extent of the prosopography and convict name matching for ships disembarking at Port Phillip and Norfolk Island is not as comprehensive as for those who were disembarked in Van Diemen's Land because base population sources have not yet been established.
  </description>
      <description type="note">
More detailed and customised datasets are made available to members of the project team to support specific research agendas and research questions. If the specific data you require to support your research is not included in these basic collections, please make contact with the project and present your request for data and/or participation via the project's public website.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "calcutta" at Port Phillip on 1803-10-09 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "calcutta" at Port Phillip on 1803-10-09

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): calcutta
 * sailed date : 1803-04-24 from Spithead
 * arrival date : 1803-10-09
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:307 Men ; Deaths:8 Men ; Landed:299(PP) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.41" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Lord Melville" at Van Diemen's Land on 1818-12-17 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Lord Melville" at Van Diemen's Land on 1818-12-17

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Lord Melville
 * sailed date : 1818-07-15 from unknown location
 * arrival date : 1818-12-17
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:148 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:147(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "356.18" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Dromedary" at Van Diemen's Land on 1820-01-10 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Dromedary" at Van Diemen's Land on 1820-01-10

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Dromedary
 * sailed date : 1819-09-11 from England
 * arrival date : 1820-01-10
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:370 Men ; Relanded:1; Landed:22(NSW) and 347(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "356.22" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Guildford" at Van Diemen's Land on 1820-10-28 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Guildford" at Van Diemen's Land on 1820-10-28

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Guildford
 * sailed date : 1820-05-14 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1820-10-28
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:190 Men ; Landed:1(NSW) and 189(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "356.26" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Medway" at Van Diemen's Land on 1821-03-13 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Medway" at Van Diemen's Land on 1821-03-13

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Medway
 * sailed date : 1820-11-13 from England
 * arrival date : 1821-03-13
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:156 Men ; Landed:156(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "356.30" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Claudine" at Van Diemen's Land on 1821-12-15 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Claudine" at Van Diemen's Land on 1821-12-15

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Claudine
 * sailed date : 1821-08-24 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1821-12-15
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:160 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:159(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.02" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Mary Anne" at Van Diemen's Land on 1822-05-02 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Mary Anne" at Van Diemen's Land on 1822-05-02

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Mary Anne
 * sailed date : 1821-12-25 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1822-05-02
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:108 Women ; Deaths:1 Women ; Landed:62(NSW) and 45(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.06" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Caledonia (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1822-11-06 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Caledonia (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1822-11-06

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Caledonia (2)
 * sailed date : 1822-06-19 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1822-11-06
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:150 Men ; Deaths:6 Men ; Landed:144(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.09" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Commodore Hayes" at Van Diemen's Land on 1823-08-16 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Commodore Hayes" at Van Diemen's Land on 1823-08-16

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Commodore Hayes
 * sailed date : 1823-08-16 from unknown location
 * arrival date : 1823-08-16
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:219 Men ; Deaths:3 Men ; Landed:216(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.14" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Asia" at Van Diemen's Land on 1824-01-19 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Asia" at Van Diemen's Land on 1824-01-19

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Asia
 * sailed date : 1823-08-09 from Downs
 * arrival date : 1824-01-19
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:150 Men ; Landed:150(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.18" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Princess Charlotte" at Van Diemen's Land on 1824-11-09 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Princess Charlotte" at Van Diemen's Land on 1824-11-09

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Princess Charlotte
 * sailed date : 1824-07-09 from Downs
 * arrival date : 1824-11-09
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:140 Men ; Landed:140(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.22" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Medina" at Van Diemen's Land on 1825-09-14 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Medina" at Van Diemen's Land on 1825-09-14

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Medina
 * sailed date : 1825-04-26 from Downs
 * arrival date : 1825-09-14
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:180 Men ; Deaths:2 Men ; Landed:178(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.26" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Providence (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1826-05-16 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Providence (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1826-05-16

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Providence (2)
 * sailed date : 1825-12-24 from Downs
 * arrival date : 1826-05-16
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:100 Women ; Deaths:1 Women ; Landed:99(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.30" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Sir Charles Forbes (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1827-01-03 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Sir Charles Forbes (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1827-01-03

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Sir Charles Forbes (2)
 * sailed date : 1826-09-16 from London
 * arrival date : 1827-01-03
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:73 Women ; Deaths:4 Women ; Landed:69(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.34" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Persian" at Van Diemen's Land on 1827-08-05

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Persian
 * sailed date : 1827-04-14 from London
 * arrival date : 1827-08-05
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:60 Women ; Landed:60(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.38" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Asia (3)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1827-12-07 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Asia (3)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1827-12-07

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Asia (3)
 * sailed date : 1827-08-17 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1827-12-07
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:200 Men ; Deaths:2 Men ; Landed:198(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "358.42" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Bengal Merchant" at Van Diemen's Land on 1828-08-10 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Bengal Merchant" at Van Diemen's Land on 1828-08-10

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Bengal Merchant
 * sailed date : 1828-03-25 from Plymouth
 * arrival date : 1828-08-10
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:170 Men ; Deaths:4 Men ; Landed:166(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.04" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Roslin Castle" at Van Diemen's Land on 1828-12-16 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Roslin Castle" at Van Diemen's Land on 1828-12-16

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Roslin Castle
 * sailed date : 1828-08-19 from Downs
 * arrival date : 1828-12-16
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:176 Men ; Deaths:2 Men ; Landed:174(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.08" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "York" at Van Diemen's Land on 1829-08-28 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "York" at Van Diemen's Land on 1829-08-28

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): York
 * sailed date : 1829-05-11 from London
 * arrival date : 1829-08-28
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:192 Men ; Landed:192(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.12" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Prince Regent" at Van Diemen's Land on 1830-01-10

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Prince Regent
 * sailed date : 1829-08-21 from Sheerness
 * arrival date : 1830-01-10
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:200 Men ; Relanded:1?; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:198(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.16" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Sir Charles Forbes (3)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1830-07-27

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Sir Charles Forbes (3)
 * sailed date : 1830-04-05 from Plymouth
 * arrival date : 1830-07-27
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:160 Men ; Deaths:2 Men ; Landed:158(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.20" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Royal George" at Van Diemen's Land on 1830-10-18 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Royal George" at Van Diemen's Land on 1830-10-18

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Royal George
 * sailed date : 1830-06-27 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1830-10-18
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:215 Men ; Deaths:4 Men ; Landed:211(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.24" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "John" at Van Diemen's Land on 1831-01-28 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "John" at Van Diemen's Land on 1831-01-28

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): John
 * sailed date : 1830-10-14 from Spithead
 * arrival date : 1831-01-28
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:200 Men ; Landed:200(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.28" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Argyle" at Van Diemen's Land on 1831-08-03 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Argyle" at Van Diemen's Land on 1831-08-03

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Argyle
 * sailed date : 1831-03-18 from Plymouth
 * arrival date : 1831-08-03
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:250 Men ; Relanded:1; Deaths:5 Men ; Landed:244(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.32" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "William Glen Anderson" at Van Diemen's Land on 1831-11-01 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "William Glen Anderson" at Van Diemen's Land on 1831-11-01

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): William Glen Anderson
 * sailed date : 1831-06-02 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1831-11-01
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:166 Men ; Landed:166(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.36" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Gilmore" at Van Diemen's Land on 1832-03-22 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Gilmore" at Van Diemen's Land on 1832-03-22

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Gilmore
 * sailed date : 1831-11-27 from London
 * arrival date : 1832-03-22
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:224 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:223(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.40" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Lord William Bentinck" at Van Diemen's Land on 1832-08-28

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Lord William Bentinck
 * sailed date : 1832-05-07 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1832-08-28
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:186 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:185(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "360.44" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Circassian" at Van Diemen's Land on 1833-02-16 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Circassian" at Van Diemen's Land on 1833-02-16

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Circassian
 * sailed date : 1832-10-14 from Plymouth
 * arrival date : 1833-02-16
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:186 Men ; Landed:186(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.02" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Jane" at Van Diemen's Land on 1833-06-30

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Jane
 * sailed date : 1833-02-22 from Torbay
 * arrival date : 1833-06-30
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:115 Women ; Deaths:2 Women ; Landed:113(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.06" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Stakesby" at Van Diemen's Land on 1833-09-04 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Stakesby" at Van Diemen's Land on 1833-09-04

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Stakesby
 * sailed date : 1833-05-22 from Spithead
 * arrival date : 1833-09-04
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:216 Men ; Landed:216(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.10" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Southworth (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1834-01-14

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Southworth (2)
 * sailed date : 1833-09-25 from Sheerness
 * arrival date : 1834-01-14
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:190 Men ; Deaths:2 Men ; Landed:188(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.14" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Edward" at Van Diemen's Land on 1834-09-04

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Edward
 * sailed date : 1834-05-05 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1834-09-04
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:151 Women ; Landed:151(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.18" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Waterloo" at Van Diemen's Land on 1835-03-03

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Waterloo
 * sailed date : 1834-10-27 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1835-03-03
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:224 Men ; Landed:224(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.22" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Norfolk" at Van Diemen's Land on 1835-08-28 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Norfolk" at Van Diemen's Land on 1835-08-28

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Norfolk
 * sailed date : 1835-05-14 from Sheerness
 * arrival date : 1835-08-28
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:280 Men ; Landed:280(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.26" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Bardaster" at Van Diemen's Land on 1836-01-13

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Bardaster
 * sailed date : 1835-09-16 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1836-01-13
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:240 Men ; Deaths:5 Men ; Landed:235(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.30" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Lord Lyndoch (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1836-08-20

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Lord Lyndoch (2)
 * sailed date : 1836-04-24 from London
 * arrival date : 1836-08-20
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:330 Men ; Deaths:5 Men ; Landed:325(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.34" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Eden" at Van Diemen's Land on 1836-12-22

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Eden
 * sailed date : 1836-08-31 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1836-12-22
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:280 Men ; Deaths:3 Men ; Landed:277(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.38" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Elphinstone (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1837-10-02 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Elphinstone (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1837-10-02

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Elphinstone (2)
 * sailed date : 1837-06-01 from Downs
 * arrival date : 1837-10-02
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:240 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:239(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.42" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Royal Sovereign" at Van Diemen's Land on 1838-01-09 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Royal Sovereign" at Van Diemen's Land on 1838-01-09

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Royal Sovereign
 * sailed date : 1837-08-31 from Sheerness
 * arrival date : 1838-01-09
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:150 Men ; Landed:150(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "362.46" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Lord William Bentinck (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1838-08-26

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Lord William Bentinck (2)
 * sailed date : 1838-04-14 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1838-08-26
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:320 Men ; Deaths:3 Men ; Landed:317(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.03" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Augusta Jessie (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1838-12-06

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Augusta Jessie (2)
 * sailed date : 1838-08-14 from London
 * arrival date : 1838-12-06
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:210 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:209(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.07" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Marquis of Hastings" at Van Diemen's Land on 1839-07-23 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Marquis of Hastings" at Van Diemen's Land on 1839-07-23

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Marquis of Hastings
 * sailed date : 1839-03-17 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1839-07-23
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:240 Men ; Deaths:7 Men ; Landed:233(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.11" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Canton" at Van Diemen's Land on 1840-01-12 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Canton" at Van Diemen's Land on 1840-01-12

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Canton
 * sailed date : 1839-09-22 from Spithead
 * arrival date : 1840-01-12
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:240 Men ; Deaths:?10 Men ; Landed:230(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.15" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Mandarin" at Van Diemen's Land on 1840-06-30

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Mandarin
 * sailed date : 1840-02-25 from Spithead
 * arrival date : 1840-06-30
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:212 Men ; Relanded:1; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:210(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.18" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "nautilus" at Norfolk Island on 1840

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): nautilus
 * sailed date : 1839-09-17 from Dublin
 * arrival date : 1840
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:200 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:178(NI) and 21(NSW) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "372.12" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Lady Raffles" at Van Diemen's Land on 1841-03-17 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Lady Raffles" at Van Diemen's Land on 1841-03-17

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Lady Raffles
 * sailed date : 1840-12-02 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1841-03-17
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:330 Men ; Deaths:3 Men ; Landed:327(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.24" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Rajah" at Van Diemen's Land on 1841-07-19

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Rajah
 * sailed date : 1841-04-05 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1841-07-19
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:190 Women ; Relanded:10; Deaths:1 Women ; Landed:179(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.28" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Westmoreland (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1841-09-12 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Westmoreland (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1841-09-12

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Westmoreland (2)
 * sailed date : 1841-05-19 from Sheerness
 * arrival date : 1841-09-12
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:202 Men ; Deaths:2 Men ; Landed:200(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.31" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Mexborough" at Van Diemen's Land on 1841-12-26

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Mexborough
 * sailed date : 1841-08-12 from Dublin
 * arrival date : 1841-12-26
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:145 Women ; Deaths:2 Women ; Landed:143(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.36" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Richard Webb" at Van Diemen's Land on 1842-03-04

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Richard Webb
 * sailed date : 1841-11-15 from Dublin
 * arrival date : 1842-03-04
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:193 Men ; Deaths:4 Men ; Landed:189(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.40" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Somersetshire" at Van Diemen's Land on 1842-05-30 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Somersetshire" at Van Diemen's Land on 1842-05-30

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Somersetshire
 * sailed date : 1841-12-20 from Plymouth
 * arrival date : 1842-05-30
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:219 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:218(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "364.44" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Elphinstone (3)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1842-07-28

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Elphinstone (3)
 * sailed date : 1842-04-10 from Downs
 * arrival date : 1842-07-28
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:230 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:229(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.03" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Royal Admiral" at Van Diemen's Land on 1842-09-24

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Royal Admiral
 * sailed date : 1842-05-05 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1842-09-24
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:204 Women ; Deaths:2 Women ; Landed:202(c)(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.07" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Emily" at Van Diemen's Land on 1842-11-24

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Emily
 * sailed date : 1842-06-28 from Sheerness
 * arrival date : 1842-11-24
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:240 Men ; Deaths:2 Men ; Landed:238(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.11" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Waterloo (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1842

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Waterloo (2)
 * sailed date : 1842-06-01 from Sheerness
 * arrival date : 1842
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:220 Men ; Relanded:1; Deaths:144 Men ; Landed:72(d)(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.12" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Garland Grove (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1843-01-20

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Garland Grove (2)
 * sailed date : 1842-10-02 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1843-01-20
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:191 Women ; Relanded:1; Deaths:8 Women ; Landed:182(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.19" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Gilmore (3)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1843-08-19

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Gilmore (3)
 * sailed date : 1843-04-14 from Sheerness
 * arrival date : 1843-08-19
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:?254 Men ; Deaths:3 Men ; Landed:249(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.23" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Asiatic" at Van Diemen's Land on 1843-09-23 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Asiatic" at Van Diemen's Land on 1843-09-23

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Asiatic
 * sailed date : 1843-05-28 from Sheerness
 * arrival date : 1843-09-23
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:188 Men ; Deaths:2 Men ; Landed:186(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.27" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Henrietta" at Van Diemen's Land on 1843-11-19

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Henrietta
 * sailed date : 1843-07-13 from London
 * arrival date : 1843-11-19
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:190 Men ; Landed:190(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.31" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Anson" at Van Diemen's Land on 1844-02-04 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Anson" at Van Diemen's Land on 1844-02-04

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Anson
 * sailed date : 1843-10-01 from Plymouth
 * arrival date : 1844-02-04
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:506 Men ; Relanded:6; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:499(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.35" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Equestrian" at Van Diemen's Land on 1844-05-02 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Equestrian" at Van Diemen's Land on 1844-05-02

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Equestrian
 * sailed date : 1844-01-20 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1844-05-02
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:290 Men ; Deaths:2 Men ; Landed:288(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.38" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Maria Somes" at Van Diemen's Land on 1844-07-30 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Maria Somes" at Van Diemen's Land on 1844-07-30

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Maria Somes
 * sailed date : 1844-04-25 from London
 * arrival date : 1844-07-30
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:264 Men ; Deaths:2 Men ; Landed:262(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.41" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Emily (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1844-10-30 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Emily (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1844-10-30

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Emily (2)
 * sailed date : 1844-07-14 from Dublin
 * arrival date : 1844-10-30
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:205 Men ; Landed:205(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.45" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "William Jardine" at Van Diemen's Land on 1844-11-20 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "William Jardine" at Van Diemen's Land on 1844-11-20

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): William Jardine
 * sailed date : 1844-08-11 from London
 * arrival date : 1844-11-20
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:270 Men ; Deaths:3 Men ; Landed:267(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "366.47" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "hydrabad" at Norfolk Island on 1845-02-19

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): hydrabad
 * sailed date : 1844-10-21 from Downs
 * arrival date : 1845-02-19
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:260 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:259(NI) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "372.18" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Mount Stewart Elphinstone" at Van Diemen's Land on 1845-06-19

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Mount Stewart Elphinstone
 * sailed date : 1845-03-07 from London
 * arrival date : 1845-06-19
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:266 Men ; Relanded:6; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:259(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "368.06" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Ratcliffe" at Van Diemen's Land on 1845-08-30 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Ratcliffe" at Van Diemen's Land on 1845-08-30

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Ratcliffe
 * sailed date : 1845-05-19 from Dublin
 * arrival date : 1845-08-30
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:215 Men ; Landed:215(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "368.09" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Lloyds" at Van Diemen's Land on 1845-11-07

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Lloyds
 * sailed date : 1845-07-26 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1845-11-07
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:170 Women ; Landed:170(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "368.12" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "mayda" at Norfolk Island on 1846-01-08

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): mayda
 * sailed date : 1845-08-29 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1846-01-08
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:199 Men ; Deaths:4 Men ; Landed:195(NI) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "372.21" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Joseph Somes" at Van Diemen's Land on 1846-05-19

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Joseph Somes
 * sailed date : 1845-12-22 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1846-05-19
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:?250 Men ; Deaths:7 Men ; Landed:243(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "368.17" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Sea Queen" at Van Diemen's Land on 1846-08-29 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Sea Queen" at Van Diemen's Land on 1846-08-29

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Sea Queen
 * sailed date : 1846-05-12 from London
 * arrival date : 1846-08-29
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:170 Women ; Deaths:1 Women ; Landed:169(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "368.21" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Elizabeth and Henry (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1847-01-04

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Elizabeth and Henry (2)
 * sailed date : 1846-09-17 from London
 * arrival date : 1847-01-04
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:170 Women ; Relanded:1; Landed:169(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "368.23" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "thomasarbuthnot" at Port Phillip on 1847-05-04

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): thomasarbuthnot
 * sailed date : 1847-01-10 from Portland
 * arrival date : 1847-05-04
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:289 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:288(PP) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "372.04" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "tory" at Norfolk Island on 1847 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "tory" at Norfolk Island on 1847

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): tory
 * sailed date : 1846-11-11 from Dublin
 * arrival date : 1847
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:200 Men ; Deaths:5 Men ; Landed:195(NI) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "372.24" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "John Calvin" at Van Diemen's Land on 1848-05-18

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): John Calvin
 * sailed date : 1848-01-24 from Dublin
 * arrival date : 1848-05-18
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:171 Women ; Deaths:1 Women ; Landed:170(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "368.31" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Elizabeth and Henry (3)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1848-06-30

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Elizabeth and Henry (3)
 * sailed date : 1848-02-13 from London
 * arrival date : 1848-06-30
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:170 Women ; Deaths:1 Women ; Landed:169(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "368.34" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Ratcliffe (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1848-11-12

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Ratcliffe (2)
 * sailed date : 1848-07-29 from Spithead
 * arrival date : 1848-11-12
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:250 Men ; Deaths:?2 Men ; Landed:248(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "368.38" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Blenheim (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1849-02-02 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Blenheim (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1849-02-02

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Blenheim (2)
 * sailed date : 1849-02-02 from Dublin
 * arrival date : 1849-02-02
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:300 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:299(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "368.42" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "randolph" at Port Phillip on 1849-08-08 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "randolph" at Port Phillip on 1849-08-08

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): randolph
 * sailed date : 1849-04-28 from London
 * arrival date : 1849-08-08
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:300 Men ; Deaths:5 Men ; Landed:295(NSW) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "372.10" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Adelaide" at Van Diemen's Land on 1849-11-29

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Adelaide
 * sailed date : 1849-08-17 from Portland
 * arrival date : 1849-11-29
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:303 Men ; Relanded:3; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:259(NSW) and 40(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.04" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "St. Vincent" at Van Diemen's Land on 1850-04-04 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "St. Vincent" at Van Diemen's Land on 1850-04-04

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): St. Vincent
 * sailed date : 1849-12-19 from Downs
 * arrival date : 1850-04-04
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:207 Women ; Deaths:2 Women ; Landed:205(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.06" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Blenheim (3)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1850-07-24

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Blenheim (3)
 * sailed date : 1850-04-10 from Plymouth
 * arrival date : 1850-07-24
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:300 Men ; Relanded:7?; Deaths:4 Men ; Landed:289(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.09" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Duke of Cornwall" at Van Diemen's Land on 1850-10-27

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Duke of Cornwall
 * sailed date : 1850-10-27 from Dublin
 * arrival date : 1850-10-27
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:200 Women ; Deaths:2 Women ; Landed:198(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.13" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Emma Eugenia (4)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1851-03-07

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Emma Eugenia (4)
 * sailed date : 1850-10-30 from London
 * arrival date : 1851-03-07
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:170 Women ; Landed:170(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.17" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="brief">List of convicts who disembarked from convict ship "Cornwall" at Van Diemen's Land on 1851-06-11 generated from the Founders and Survivors research project's prosopography database as at 2012-04-24T15:22:53.</description>
      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Cornwall" at Van Diemen's Land on 1851-06-11

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Cornwall
 * sailed date : 1851-02-24 from P'smouth
 * arrival date : 1851-06-11
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:300 Men ; Deaths:1 Men ; Landed:299(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.21" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Anna Maria (2)" at Van Diemen's Land on 1852-01-26

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Anna Maria (2)
 * sailed date : 1851-10-06 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1852-01-26
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:200 Women ; Deaths:4 Women ; Landed:196(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.25" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Sir Robert Seppings" at Van Diemen's Land on 1852-07-08

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Sir Robert Seppings
 * sailed date : 1852-03-18 from Woolwich
 * arrival date : 1852-07-08
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:220 Women ; Deaths:1 Women ; Landed:219(VDL) Women 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.29" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Lady Montagu" at Van Diemen's Land on 1852-12-09

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Lady Montagu
 * sailed date : 1852-08-09 from Plymouth
 * arrival date : 1852-12-09
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:290 Men ; Deaths: Men O Men ; Landed:280(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.33" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.

      <description type="full">
This collection provides a complete list of convict names and sufficient biographical data to enable unambiguous identification of convicts who were disembarked from convict ship "Oriental Queen" at Van Diemen's Land on 1853-02-19

This includes, where known, an estimation of the year of birth, place of birth, where and when convicted, the sentence, the date of arrival in the colony and the convict's age on arrival. The brief convict biographical data provided in this collection serves as an index into the far more extensive set of life course events which are recorded in the prosopgraphy database built by the Founders and Survivors project.

Basic details for this ship:
 * ship name (as known in VDL records): Oriental Queen
 * sailed date : 1852-11-04 from Plymouth
 * arrival date : 1853-02-19
 * population (per Bateson's The Convict Ships): Embarked:280 Men ; Deaths:3 Men ; Landed:277(VDL) Men 

Data for convicts listed in this collection comes from the source which has been determined by Founders and Survivors to form the "base population" for this ship. Further information as to the methodology and the linkage of multiple sources is detailed in the narrative format of the collection. The matching and linkage of additional sources about Tasmanian convict's is the subject of ongoing research. This collection may be repuplished regularly, and in additional formats and with specific user interfaces, to enable public participation in the quality of convict matching and linkage -- see for example the EXPERIMENTAL linkage.htm format for this collection.
Linkage for ships arriving at Norfolk Island and Port Philip is incomplete.

This ship's prosopography index is published in a directory named "370.37" (the ship's project id). Three three different file formats provided:
 -- (default; suitable for web browsing) HTML: world wide web hypertext markup language format which provides a "narrative" view of the collection (index.htm); and
 -- (structured prosopgraphy: persons and events) XML / TEIp5 : Text Encoding Initiative (version p5) XML format which provides the underlying XML database for this collection (index.xml); and
 -- [Not yet available] (row/column flat) simple list of convict names in a flat file, tab delimited, suitable for Excel, Stata, SPSS or database usage (index.tab). See notes below.
