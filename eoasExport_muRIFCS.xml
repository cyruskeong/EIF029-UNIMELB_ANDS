         <description type="full">The University of Melbourne eScholarship Research Centre (ESRC) functions both as an academic centre and a focus of infrastructure design testing and deployment. It was created from the Australian Science and Technology Heritage Centre and innovative staff in Information Services, to work collaboratively with researchers, research teams and projects across the University. The Centre comprises a mixture of academic researchers, archivists, librarians, systems analysts, technology developers and programmers, project managers, information technology support staff, web design and useability experts and as a rule these are not separate individuals.</description>

         <description type="full">The Encyclopedia of Australian Science is an online register of people, corporations, research institutions, scientific societies and other organisations that have contributed to Australia's scientific, technological and medical heritage.

It incorporates the following data on people and organisations: name; alternative names; date and place of birth and death if known; occupations or fields of specialisation; a summary note outlining their life and work; a timeline of career positions or events; a list of other registered people, organisations and archival holdings and published resources they are connected to.

The registry is currently managed by the eScholarship Research Centre at the University of Melbourne. The registry was formed in February 2010 with the amalgamation of two previously separate databases, Bright Sparcs (1994-2010) and Australian Science at Work (1999-2010).</description>

         <description type="full">Bright Sparcs was an online register of people involved in the development of science, technology, engineering and medicine in Australia, including references to their archival materials and bibliographic resources.

The registry was first conceived and managed by the Australian Science Archives Project (1994-1999). It was subsequently managed by its successor organisations, the Australian Science and Technology Heritage Centre (1999-2006) and the eScholarship Research Centre (from 2007 onwards) at the University of Melbourne.

In February 2010, Bright Sparcs and the Australian Science at Work database were amalgamated to create the basis of the Encyclopedia of Australian Science.

When the register was established its parameters were to register the names and existing archival records of influential Australian scientists. As time progressed technological capacity increased and the potential for wider data parameters was realised. By the time of its closure the register included the following data on influential Australian scientists: name; alternate names; date and place of birth and death if known; occupations or fields of specialisation; a summary note outlining their life and work; a timeline of career positions; a list of other registered people, organisations and archival holdings and published resources they are connected to.</description>

Collins is currently compiling the next set of data to be included in this dataset, a bibliography of works published between 1900 and 1945.

Each publication is profiled along the following parameters: author, title, date and place of publication, subject, description, source, and for online resources web address and date of access.</description>

         <description type="full">Federation and Meteorology is an online resource drawing on the rich and authoritative historical resources of the Bureau of Meteorology, publishing on the Web for the first time major articles on meteorology that have been difficult to access until now.

Through the web-publication of seminal meteorological articles, totalling over 600,00 words, the story of the establishment of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has been told.

 The project was generously funded by the National Council for the Centenary of Federation, based on the observation that the emergence of Australian meteorology as a science parallels closely the story of Federation and was both influenced by and contributed to the ambition of nationhood.</description>

Data was collected on projects relating to the following Victorian industries:

Advanced Manufacturing Technologies
Advanced Materials
Biotechnology (Non-Medical)
Cleaner Production and Waste Management
Construction, Infrastructure and Maintenance
Energy/Alternative Energy
Food Processing
Information, Computer and Communication Technologies
Instrumentation
Manufacturing Technology

The data was collected on the premise of providing a comprehensive map of the CSIRO and its subsidiary organisations. As it stands the dataset is a document of the history and evolution of the CSIR, CSIRO's and thus the Commonwealth Government's research foci. It serves as a reflection of the changing issues facing Australian industry and society and how research was used to address them.

The parameters of data collected on each division or research facility are as follows:
Name of facility or division; dates of establishment and closure, where applicable; facility location; facility web address; note summarising work of facility; list of related people and organisations - previous, subsequent, superior or subordinate; and a list of relevant publications.</description>

         <description type="full">This dataset is the result of research that began in 1985 and is ongoing. It contains professional and biographical profiles of Australian Academy of Science (1954-) Fellows influential in the fields of science, technology and medicine. The many hundreds of fellows profiled create a picture of the scientific landscape in Australia and the issues that were faced and addressed by our most notable scientists.

It incorporates the following data relating to each Fellow: name; alternative names; date and place of birth and death if known; occupations or fields of specialisation; a summary note outlining their life and work; a timeline of career positions or events; a list of other registered people, organisations and archival holdings and published resources they are connected to.</description>
